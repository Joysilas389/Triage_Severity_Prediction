Triage Severity Prediction Model: A multiclass classification model

1. Introduction
This project aims to predict triage severity and recommend appropriate action using a supervised machine learning model. We chose to use PyCaret for our model because of its ease of use and ability to quickly build and deploy end-to-end ML prototypes.

2. Installation
To run this model, you will need to install PyCaret and any other dependencies required to run the code. You can find more information on how to install PyCaret in the official documentation.

3. Data Preparation
We prepared our data by cleaning and preprocessing it, as well as engineering new features to improve our model's performance

4. Modeling
We used PyCaret's classification module to train our model, which included tuning hyperparameters to improve its performance. 

5. Our model achieved an accuracy of 76% on the test set, with an AUC score of 0.73. We also created visualizations to help illustrate our findings, which you can find in the results.ipynb notebook.
Conclusion

6. Overall, our model performed well in predicting triage severity and recommending appropriate action. However, there is still room for improvement, such as collecting more data or trying different modeling techniques.
